The program describes the Linear Invariant Sync Algorithm (LISA). It is based on IEEE 802.11b WAN specifications to establish 
synchronization and hence helps in establishing wireless communication. 

The code only describes the algorithm and is not used in the real communication protocol. The communication happens between two LPC1769 using 433MHz RF transistor.
